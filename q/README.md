# Example of using Q library and Node JS FileSystem API

Again, just so I have a decent understanding of what's going on, this example is an attempt to get as basic as you can get in using [Kris Kowal's Q library] (https://github.com/kriskowal/q) to wrap a NodeJS FS API call. 

### Running the example

**node nReadFile.js**

The command above will output the contents of the README.md file in the same directory to the console, but will replace the phrase: 

*just get us on the ground!*

…with… 

*that part'll happen pretty definitely*
